Small collsion engine with rigidbody and softbody collisions is planned. 

I want to implement Delaunay triangulation algorythm first, then simple collision objects and solver.

C++, OpenGL on Linux. Planned to use Vulkan, but after 1200 lines of code and only rainbow square on my screen I decided to switch to OpenGL:)
